 A Tiny Solder PCB to add Omron and Kailh Mini Microswitches to Xbox Series Controller (1914) Triggers. I designed this project because I was not happy with the available market solutions for adding "hair triggers." Available DIY kits use SMD tactile buttons rather than proper microswitches, and ready-to-go modded controllers are expensive.

This set of PCBs is actually a single PCB that is flipped depending on the side of the trigger it is installed in. This mod requires a resin-printed spacer to shorten the trigger pull and ensure proper contact with the switch. Aside from that, you just need the PCB and microswitches, which together cost < $10.
